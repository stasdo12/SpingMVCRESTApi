## Design Patterns Used in Spring

Spring offers a variety of design patterns that help develop efficient and modular applications. Some of the patterns widely used in Spring include:

- **Dependency Injection (DI)**: Enables injecting dependencies into objects, reducing coupling and increasing application flexibility.
- **Inversion of Control (IoC)**: Places the lifecycle management of objects in the Spring container, freeing client code from this responsibility.
- **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**: Provides a pattern for separating the application into models, views, and controllers, ensuring separation of concerns and improving scalability.
- **Data Access Object (DAO)**: Provides an abstraction for interacting with the database, simplifying data storage operations.
- **Service Layer**: Defines the business logic layer where business requests are handled and data operations are performed.
- **Repository Pattern**: Provides an abstraction for data access and management of persistent objects.
